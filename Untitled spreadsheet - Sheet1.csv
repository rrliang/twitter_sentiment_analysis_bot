his body and dip him in a tub of Hydrogen Peroxide. Afterwards, I would recut the wounds and apply a scorpion's sting to 30 of them over a time period of 2 hours after
which I would nurse his health a tad. Next, I would rip his nails out and pour bleach and
ammonia on them while making sure he doesn't inhale any. I would shoot him in his
knee with a crossbow and since I'm an honorable man I would make this the last of his

Griefing: I like to take my time in order to cause the most damage, but I have attacked
many servers with a hit-and-run style of disruption before and caused massive amounts of
damage. I would like to say that my best griefing attack was the Scattered Space incident,
although the damage wasn't intense compared to most of my attacks on servers, I stirred
up plenty of drama in their community.
Cooperation: I would like to think myself as that of a rogue in many situations, but I have
shown to be able to work with others. Considering our personalities, I don't think I would
have any troubles with group raiding.
Admins: I can bullshit my way out of things, but I am a honest man. If I focus, I can have
a silver tounge that avoids truthfulness.

0,"July 26th, 2012
In my dream, I went into a bizarre dimension with blue spots in terrain, Rocky Black and
grey terrain, and a cloudy black sky. I didn't see the sky, but out of nowhere, a powerful
being appeared to me, and the sky had a thin plate of volcanic, powerful orange (gaseous
like) material. The being spoke to me words with power, which I can't really recall. In my
next dream, I was awake, in my bed, and there was an alien there. I was being hooked
with wires to my brain, sort of feeding me information. It was feeding me dreams within
my own dream, kind of like inception. In this dream thing, I was studying the possible
amount of dreams. There was a chart, like the audacity ogg vorbis specs one. There was a
limit to dreams and personality, according to the info.
The info I remember is:
Personality: 136,742
Dreams: 144 million or more (relative to your body? Or could it be more?)
There was another dream about school. See, last year, I dropped back in after dropping
out from absolute f'ing hell. I usually saw this poor bloke while passing to the next
class. Probably 14 or 15, but he barely did anything to warrant any bullying, yet he got so
much ♥♥♥♥ for everything. I've probably interacted with the kid 3 times; the 1st was seeing some of my friends trying to cheer him up, the 2nd was seeing him get ♥♥♥♥ed
with by some jock idiots, in which I pulled a knife on them and intimidated them into
leaving, and the 3rd was where he had this delicate science project, so I basically daunted
the idiots in the middle of the hallway into getting to class and made sure that this kid's
project wasn't ruined by D-bags.
In my thoughts, I could just see myself at an earlier age in the kid. So, the dream directed
my mind into the social 'chart' of the kid and the students in general, in which I just kind
of got a broader social look in people; i.e. being able to 'put myself into other people's
shoes'. I worked and thought and came up with a moral that I really need to reach that kid
and prevent anything bad from happening, because I don't want someone to have to deal
with the mentality that can develop from that.
The dream flashed to another dream, which was a type of mind probe in a way. I just felt
like I was being read. I was having to face my own flaws in a very disturbing and hostile
state of REM.
I kind of woke up and still felt the alien type thing (Probably caused from human natural
DMT from last sentence) glaring at me. It kind of had that 'snobby' or arrogant type of
personality seen from some reports of aliens. While I woke up, that thing kind of faded
off probably due to the release of DMT stopping.
Just for reference, I haven't done DMT or LSD. I've been clean from any type of drug
(Tobacco / Alcohol / weed) for 3 months before that dream."

a shotgun blast without hearing protection could make you permanently deaf.
even a .22 is loud enough to be heard for a 1km radius at least.
Guns are extremely loud, extremely deadly and need to be respected.
A suppressed gun is still loud. Only an Oil Filter + .22 subsonic will be truly 'silenced'."

point in dishing out $30k a year just to get into college, only for most people to either
drop out or get a useless degree, or something they're not entirely interested in.
I don't think everything should be free, but there's one thing that absolutely must be-
Education. Primary and Secondary school is free for students, which is excellent because
every human deserves the chance and the right to be educated.
Yet in college, most the time it's going into a huge room with a hundred other students,
taking notes of what the professor says, and then studying your ass off to try to actually
pass the class. A lot of times, the teachers aren't even good at teaching in the first place.
Yet in Elementary ~ High, you have teachers working their ass off, helping each student at
the rise of a hand.
So normally school only costs tax payers. You get all the help you need for free, during
class. You can fuck up all you want.
College, you pay a FUCKLOAD of $$$ for, get shitty teachers, have to do everything
yourself, and have a low chance of success.

Modern women, however, don't raise their kids. I know my little brother's best friend lived
in a household with a single mother. She was 250+ pounds, made him do all of the chores
and cleaning, and ignored the two youngest children. Those kids have spent most of their
time playing video games instead of being taught values and morality. They will not have
anything to reflect back on when they are older, and it is likely they will grow up weaker
physically and mentally than would be.
That single mother? She married a jock football player at age 17, only to divorce him 8
years later and stunt the family. 50$ says she probably had some nice guy friends who she
neglected or treated like shit. If she married one of the nerds / nice guys, I'd guarantee the
entire family would be better off.
Women ignore and bully nice guys, and leave them to be rather miserable and rejected
for their lifetime. The intellectuals and benevolent people usually never get laid and
get bullied well into adulthood. It doesn't really change after high school. Yet retards,
gearheads, and douchebags get rewarded for their idiocies.
This is evidence enough that women are stupid. Dish in the constant nagging, gold-
digging, manipulating, hypersexuality, cheating and so many other aspects of the typical
'liberated' woman, and anyone who doesn't have their head in their ass will agree that
civilization has a major moral crisis going on.

In this town (flora vista)..
#1. I have no education. I dropped out of AHS back in ~10, then was forced to attend again
and dropped out again in ~12. I had a 3.5 GPA but the culture there was backwards as hell,
as if it was stuck in the 1950s. Nothing but savages and douchebags. I never motivated
myself to get a GED, I need the forced classes and structure of school, but couldn't deal
with all the methheads, roughnecks and rednecks.
#2. I have no job, I tried to apply at a few places, Wendys, General Dollar, and Dairy
Queen. All rejected lol And besides, I don't have the strength to deal with those people,
I can be a hard worker, but I got real bad social anxiety, hate and fear of all these people.
Plus I don't got a phone to keep in touch with the boss if they force me to go in for
overtime. I got a nocturnal schedule anyways. No car though, nor a license.
#3. I have no friends here. All my friends are digital now, only time in life that I had a
social life were the times I didnt live in the four corners. I tried a lot during my childhood
in this area. But let me just put it this way- one of my friends and their little brothers and
sisters, stealthily stole my Playstation 1 I had since the 90s, along with dozens of games -
all which could be worth thousands of dollars nowadays.
During high school, the other borrowed my N64 and games over the summer, promising
to return them once school started again, and guess what the jackass did? He sold it to a
guy in denver for $200. Didn't even give me any of the dough. Then threatened to kick my
ass when I defended myself from some hicks.
The others talked crap behind my back.. There was a time though around 4/20/12 when
I got high with a few people out in the hills. One of the kids lived a few houses down and
when I dropped out didn't even stop over to say hello.
I may not seem the type, but I've been somewhat outgoing, friendly, a joker. I wasn't
that kid who actively avoided people all the time and dressed in all black and listened to
goth music. I went in, did my damned work, made straight A's then went home to a crap
abusive family and did more work and surfed the net.
My point? I tried to socialize in this shit town but to no avail.
#4. Major Depression, large amounts of anger and hatred, lots of boredom.. I used to cure
it through bong hits and video games but I cant even find those enjoyable anymore.
My dad's a fat lazy idiot who watches fox news all day, weighs 350 pounds and throws
hissy fits over everything. Never even bothered to help me get my drivers license and I'm
not entitled or spoiled or anything, I'd gladly get a job and pay for my own car.
My moms a psycho hillbilly drunk from florida who's really mentally ill. She smokes and
drinks a lot and smells disgusting, and has no manners whatsoever. The most hillbilly
accent you can imagine.
My bro is an antisocial douche with no education at 27. He's a user, always manipulating
people and draining their resources. He moved back in to this crap house with his wife
who bored 2 kids from some other guy, ex-meth, no education either.
I got literally 0 contacts and I'm too lazy to get a GED.
Look, I'm sorry if I'm rude and hateful or anything, but I don't know what to do. I've lived
no life for nearly 19 years, most of which was in the miserable ass sun-belt. Did you know
new mexico has the fourth highest suicide rate?
I don't know if I'm even gonna get an education. I don't want to sound dumb but going
into the wild is another option, but I'm thinking of getting a truck with those roofed
installations on the back, then putting a bed in there and driving out of new mexico.
the DMV is being whiny and asking for a proof of bank account and proof of rent or
something; they're one of the worst DMVs out there and that's saying something, eh?
I am the only atheist I know in my town, and I've had knives pulled on me over it. If I do
drift, I need a gun, a water purifier, medkit and some MREs. I've been thinking of driving
to either the Denver area, San Jose, CA, Oregon, Washington, or Maine. I'd love to become
a Canadian resident, but I gotta get a GED, get accepted into a 4 year college before I have
any chances. It'd be nearing the 2020s before that.
Every day I wake up filled with misery, boredom and hatred. In fact, I spent most of the
2010s only on youtube, barely any forums, or in school where I was pretty miserable. I do
get out of the house every day, where I take 2~4 hour walks to shed off some pounds and
build stamina.
Here's my area. I dont like giving out personal info too much but I just want to prove my
point. I live in the heart of the southwest, with no cities for like 200 miles in any direction.
This causes an effect where the area I'm in is extremely rural. With the mormon influence
of utah, it also makes it really republican, like 80%. Everyone does meth, tobacco like

raise them. A lot of the parents are immature and careless themselves. You see this all the

insignificant. I remember going to the mall with my older bro and overhearing some
stupid teenagers talking about that one 'friday' music video - and how they enjoyed it.

all arabs and 'japs'.

In all honestly, I think they need to legalize prostitution. Give these virgins in the gaming
industry some escorts instead of ugly fat feminists. The escorts are sexually experienced.
The feminists have a good chance to be.. not only inexperienced, but to cut your chode off.
They'd also yell at you constantly.
I want actual equality and equal responsibilities. Feminists nowadays want to create this
nightmarish 1984 authoritarian matriarchal degenesis. I know most of you probably got
like brown hair and neckbeards or something. You have no experience with firearms. But
it's about time you start training, because when the civil war comes in like 20 years, I want

Another documentary to archive. I'll definitely check it out!
Aight now I'm done with all those posts so let me move back to discussing Jeff Weise. I
don't give a fuck about the new stigma of giving attention to killers, as it's going to happen
anyways. Let me just say I bet green money Jeff knew if he just killed himself he wouldn't
be remembered by more than like a dozen people. All who gave him shit wouldn't
care and would laugh at him anyways and think of him as weak. You cannot hope for
any decency from a bunch of scumbags who lack any form of empathy anyways. Mass
murderers kill for fame.
I know its a bit out of place to write a TL;DR piece about jeff on another article, but
whatever. If you look at the area where he lived, it's on a native american reservation. I live
near the largest one in the US, the navajo nation. There's a huge crime rate there, with
extreme homicide/suicide rates, and everyone is dirt poor. It's a fucking 3rd world country
in the middle of fucking nowhere (arizona). Now imagine instead of a desert wasteland, a
cold, (even more) isolated place far from a city.
Imagine all the pain 'regret' went through. His parents dying, having only his
grandparents to depend on, in the middle of nowhere back before the internet became
super-social. Of course when he went postal it did get 15 minutes of fame, but nobody
knows who he is... because he isn't some suburban white boy. There's a bias on other
races.
Come next march, it will be 10 years since his death! That's an entire decade that's passed.
If ghosts exist, that means the bloke had to deal with a decade of extra misery, now
possibly tormented by 8 victims.
As for the kid who went postal today, he only killed like 3 so it's not sufficient enough to
become a household name. Since he's white if he just dished in 6 more souls the circus
would be in full swing..."

You might not wanna admit it, but those 2 fuckers had style. Most of these events
has some pissed off depressed kid go and kill like 2~3 people. Some who are actually
competent, like lanza or cho, kill dozens, but leave behind nothing but incoherent
ramblings. The columbine weirdos did their act right around the turn of the millenium,
in a suburban culture-war area, filled with uptight soccermom cunts, and had carefully
manipulated everyone and everything into order. They carried lots of knives, and 99
bombs. If their propane bombs detonated, there'd be 450+ deaths from the blasts alone.
They also left behind journals, videos, etc. Plus the police report was like 20,000 pages
long. Waco made a dent in the american morale, mcveigh left a bigger one. Columbine
ruined school even further, and issued in a huge ass moral panic. A generation later,
columbine is still a household name, and nobody remembers that word for the beautiful
flower you can find in colorado, but for that event that happened a fuckin decade and'a'
half ago.
tl;dr all these kids know about it even though they were like toddlers back then, because
it's still very famous today. They look up to the killers because they were bullied and
got revenge on the system (school) that torments them. Little do these kids know that
the killers murdered mostly innocent people; A students. Like I said, go look up Daniel

There were about 5 major families which most people belonged to. If you got in a fight

The police were often incompetent and corrupt, even before the crisis..

Most violent crimes are down overall, except (most likely) in warzones like Chi-raq or

However, mass shooting & mass murder incidents have sharply risen since Columbine;
Any significant massacre (6+ dead) usually triggers extreme shockwaves culturally, and
a lot of gun owners buy out as much fucking ammo as possible, causing these hikes in
prices. My original post was simply warning any future gun owners to be weary of any
tragedies that now occur much more frequently.

striking are significantly higher now."
0,"I strongly suggest using .22's for hobbyists / beginners, for obvious reasons.
Get a .22 rifle for around $150-200 in america. The ammo is usually cheap, like $0.05-.08
for a standard quality .22 lr cartridge. Since mass murder is common now in america, a
lot of people usually buy up as much ammo as they can, leading to shortages and price
hikes, so take notice of these events and plan your wallet accordingly.
22 lr isn't very expensive, and is very great for target practice. If you need to defend
yourself, it is still quite capable of being fatal, but learn a mozambique drill.
If you just want a light-weight / agile / small self defense weapon, save up $500 for a .45
glock or something..
When you're ready to move on from a .22 to bigger game but want to spend only a few
hundred, get either a single-shot shotgun chambered in 12/16, or try to get a surplus

2007~2010 i had derek and a few other kids hang with me frequently
2010 i moved back here and barely had anyone hang out at all
2012 was done with education and became a neet
2014 my health rapidly delcined and mental state as well

they werent able to find me by tyhe time they drove home

they were going to the skate park and it was int he direction of the park where i need to
cross to get home
then we got drunk and smoked some cigs with jane at the end
they hung out with me for a big as we ranted about this fuckin town bro

Sawed offs will fuck you up with the recoil, you can't be accurate AT ALL firing full auto,

I'm from a military background, I've shot guns a lot before, and understand how

designed to kill, anyone who denies that is retarded to an extreme. But guns are power,

little advancement..

arts degeree, you deserve to work minimum wage through your 20s.

dropouts can't get 90% of the jobs. Stay in school and deal with the bullshit, the bullies,

Social skills is 70% of what will make you succeed.

Work your ass off, get a stem field, graduate from university there and make a 6 digit

and hell if you don't feel like going that far, get certified in welding, trucking, plumbing
or electronics. You'll make anywhere from $30~60,000 a year. WORK for the oil fields if
you can. It's scary and extreme work, but you can make 100,000 easily after a few months.

0,"Violent media usually prevents real life violence and I can easily be generic and pull this
little chart out to prove it. (check the attached image) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8676954/Doom-creator-John-
Carmack-violent-video-games-reduce-real-world-aggression.html
Like I said earlier, a newly 13 yr old kid from my town downright killed himself. He had
a upper-middle class family (200,000 / yr ) .. which confuses me as to why they would
move to this ugly, redneck rundown desert shithole of a town.. Anyways, he fucking kills
himself from all the bullshit from the town.
I usually take daily walks, ever since 2014 when I stopped being as much as a shut-
in. I casually talk to a few people here and there. I remember having a few lengthy
conversations with folks, and when it was relevant to the subject being discussed, I
probably brought up the story of the kid a few times.
You know what they all said about that kid? He was a sinner and deserved it. Those
arent my words, they're the words of the redneck shitheads here. They're all mormon
psychopaths addicted to tobacco and meth driving shitty pickup trucks from the 70s.
You know the movie naoplean dynamtie? Imagine that but with 50x more hostility in the
rednecks, and all the scenery replaced by ugly light-tan wasteland covered with weeds
everywhere.
My point? you cant blame that kid for killing himself. I'm not supporting his decision,
because most suicidal people are usually good people at heart. Most victims of suicide
ARE NOT REMEMBERED. I've spoken to the parents of this child and inspired them
to do what the parents of Ryan Halligan did and perhaps make a memorial site and do
public speaking on behalf of the bloke.
Now with that being said, the bloke still had great parents and a nice house, but it's not
like that would really counter the fact that the people we're surrounded with are thrice as
scary as southerners.
Weise lived far away from a lot of american civilization in a fucking rez. You all know his
life story by now so it should be of no surprise why he was so dark and disturbed.
To wrap this tl;dr post up.. The reason why most modern mass murderers exist is because
they know for a fact that suicide alone would just leave them forgotten forever. But if they
pull the trigger and take out some random people with them, the media will make them
the talk of (not only the town) but the nation and perhaps even the world.
Red Lake was on-par with columbine, and yet only got 1% as much attention. You know
why? Because they were all native americans- minorities. Even still, a lot of people still
faintly remember it 10 years later. Imagine if weise never went postal. Maybe a dozen
would've known about it enough to turn a glance his way for a moment, maybe his
grandpa would care.
It's the killer's fault for the tragedy, but society's fault for making the killers.
As for anyone thinking violent video games cause real life violence.."
0,"[Regarding a post about Jeffrey Weise:]
Thanks for a decent nonbiased post that actually contributed to the thread bro.
Like I usually say, for this specific case (Red Lake) it's hard not to feel incredibly sorry for the bloke. Given his life circumstances, very few would've overcome those challenges and
horrible experiences to become a normal person.
If I had a decent family, great genetics and didnt live in a desert shithole state, I would've
had a future and a positive outlook on life too. Even small changes like a different location
around here would've had massive effects on my psyche.
When that guy had his dad kill himself, a drunk abusive shithead for a mom (Who
became disabled for life due to a car crash) and was forced to move to a indian reservation
you cant blame him for being violent and suicidal.
Like I said, I live near the largest native rez in the country. Even 20 miles from the border
in a small quiet town, there's still lots of corruption, suicidal people (a 13 year old boy
killed himself a while ago) and no real jobs. We're mostly white, if that says anything.
Even generic american whites are living in 3rd world conditions out here.
I'm not going to troll or be evil. Mass murder is inexcusable and absolutely never
commendable.
American and most western civilization isnt even really civil. You're on your own out here.
Few friends will back you up, most people's families are close-minded and horrible, and
we're no longer the great country we say we are, we're 2nd-class compared to much of
western europe. Unless you're making 250,000$ / yr as a family unit, you are no longer
the fabled middle class of the 20th century.
Lots of people say they help the depressed /suicidal, but very few seek to help them. Hell,
depression isnt constant sadness, at least once you hit adulthood. If weise stayed alive
another 5 years before commiting suicide he would've gone absolutely insane. Once
you're done with school, life goes from easy mode to insane mode."

Since this will be the first entry in this livejournal, I feel it important to include some sort
of introduction. My name is.. well, I'd rather not leave my personal details public on the
internet. Although it is just about 2016, and LJ's heyday is a decade old, I feel Livejournal
efficient enough for my goal of creating a virtual journal. I am undergoing this project in
the slight chance that I may perish. I would rather not be completely forgotten; I'd rather
leave some digital footprints for my family and friends and any lurkers. I do not suggest
that I'm likely to die anytime soon, considering the fact that I am barely in my 20s. This
project will allow me to exercise my brand-new keyboard (AULA model on sale for $22,
original price was $50,) and my writing capabilities. It will also be nice to look back on
this journal when I am an older adult. Since it isn't being written on paper, I will be able
to recover the data for as long as this site is up. I won't accidentally spill some juice on the
note and render it unreadable, or tear it up and throw it away; you understand the point I
make.
Now then, an entry..
Today's work
I usually keep a schedule on a notepad in real life where I document each day's tasks and
chores, so I'll emulate it here;
1. Encyclopedia Dramatica; I worked on a few of my own pages along with a half dozen
other ones
2. I continued to archive various documents relating to my research and interests
3. I used my alts to upvote my content (see: whiteknighting) on a specific gaming website
4. I did a moderate amount of exercise
5. I cleaned out my grandfather's WW2 military storage unit and reorganized the
materials within
6. I cleaned my room, paying close attention to every square inch of material to clean
7. I successfully stayed up 24 hours to shift myself back to a day-schedule
8. Did a bunch of chores
9. Cleaned up my desktop, deleted bad games / media to clear up space. Notably, I
uninstalled GMOD but discovered the addons and downloads were still there. After
deleting them, I freed up 28 GB of space
10. I archived some of my media...
And most importantly..
11. I made this livejournal account!
Notable Events
I've finally been able to get insurance that allows me to be able to afford dental appointments. My dental situation is equivalent to that of a pollack, and I need to get
my four wisdom teeth extracted on the 22nd. I hope this doctor doesn't fuck this up and
permanently damage my nerves or jaw.
What I have to sayNothing much for now. Time is like a river... When you're born it goes
slowly yet you don't even comprehend it; when you are finally able to see it when you're
a young child, it flows slowly and peacefully. When you're on the verge of adolescence,
it begins to pick up pace and it quickly becomes difficult to keep track of the rippling in
the water. When you hit an adult age (around 16), you'll find it going at a dozen times the
speed that it went by as a child. Eventually, it becomes impossible to keep track of the
details.
Just how much time has passed? The last time I was truly happy with existence.. 2008;
2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 .. 7 fucking years.
My live has been a poor quality existence for the last 7 years. I have little faith my situation
is going to get better. The economy will probably never recover from the great recession.
The only people who will become president in the 2016 elections are Bernie Sanders,
Donald Trump, Hillary, or another Bush. Suffice to say, I have no faith whatsoever in my
nation anymore.

0,"It has been a while since my last entry.. Today I'll cover the following subjects; Time,
Corruption, Life and Death. These are probably going to be the most recurring subject
matter if I continue to blog..
Firstly, it's been a very long time now. I remember 2007~09 like it was yesterday, and
yet I'm starting to lose much of my memory of that time period. Let's take a look at how
much time has passed;
2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015. So 11 entire years have
passed that I've lived in this state. More than half of my life has been spent in one of the
worst states in the entire country, and the USA is one of the largest nations in the world.
When you look at the list of years, 2005 is barely that far apart from 07, and yet 05 and
06 were probably the worst years I've went through. In less than a year now, I'll begin to
experience life a decade in the future from my heyday. A decade, in seemingly the blink of
an eye. It's crazy.
Hell, as I type this, it's already been 4 years since I've left school. Mass Effect 3 is almost
4 years old already! Skyrim is already at that point. Oblivion is going to be 10 YEARS OLD
in a few months. Xbox 360's already hit that point.
My grandfather died over 10 years ago.. My loyal companion, a fat, muscular golden cat
named Piggy has been 6ft under for 4 1/2 years now as well. Crazy..
Now.. looking into the future, I see no hope. The middle class continues to die, more
americans go on welfare or poverty, the rich grow in power, suicide and mass murder
skyrockets, USA loses it's power, etc. My predictions aren't even hypothetical; they're
already happening and have been for decades.
Society has also been corrupted and decayed. Nowadays it's not even uncommon for frikin
Pre-teens to lose their v-cards. It's disgusting. Most males are backstabbing betas, or
alpha assholes. It's rare to find a good friend nowadays. You have a 50% chance of being
divorced within like 5 years at this point by an american bride. The courts are 90% in her
favor for most shit as well.
Look at the military. PC now. You're more likely to commit suicide than to be KIA. You
get treated like fucking garbage by the country you stepped up to 'defend'. It's a fucking
shithole in america now, but you don't see europeans accepting any american refugees
or migrants. Instead these assclowns let in hordes of rapists and murderers. White civilization is cucked and fucked. The world is hence, not even worth living in anymore.

Already 40 days into this year, and I doubt it's going to get any better. I've been dealing
with a moderate sickness which has caused me to miss a dentist appointment. My front
teeth are starting to cause me severe pain when pressure or liquid makes contact which
shouldn't even be happening as the dentists did 2 hours of work on them a few weeks
ago. I just got 3 cavities left to patch up and my teeth will be alright, but enough about this
shit.
For the last few weeks, I've been playing the f *** out of Grand Theft Auto IV. It's just
about 8 years old now, but I'm still finding new things every time I play. I must confess
that despite now owning GTA 5 (due to a friend gifting me it on steam), I've never beat it.
Up until I was gifted it, I never even touched the game. Despite the fact that 5 is superior
to 4 in most ways, I still find more enjoyment in GTA 4; 280+ hours of it to be precise.
Suffice to say, I'm addicted to Liberty City, and all the fucked up freaks and events that
take place within this virtual world.
Through the near-decade long time I've spent on IV, I mostly frequented the southern
half of the eastern borough, and downtown 'manhatten' and the central park. Lately,
I've been exploring the smaller obscure islands and finding a lot of shit. I modded some
health / armor regen scripts to make the game a hell of a lot less tedius, but practically
doubled the damage of the weapons and vastly expanded the range of them; the sawed
off shotgun is capable of downing someone over 200m from you (although it is VERY
unlikely due to the spread)
I've been going on GTA 4's internet and browsing these sites. I've found shit I never read
before. GTA 4 is on par with TES 4 on the amount of shit you can still discover. I was
reading blogs in game and legit threw up from one of them. It was basically some ugly
fat feminist furfag cunt talking about her perverted sexual activity with someone else and
dousing each other with dishwasher liquids. I'm just sitting here thinking.. Someone
employed at Rockstar North is even more fucked up in the head than I am. My writing
shifts more towards patrick bateman / ER shit. This rockstar jackass is just a perverted
troll with a way-overactive imagination. Fucker should see a shrink.
Well, 2007 is already 8~9 years old. It's scary to me how time just flew by. I always bitch
about how my future is bleak, and indeed the entire nation and world's is (unless you're a spoiled fucking cunt, in which case check your privileged for real, asshole) but I know I'm
not the only one thinking this shit. Obama's got less than a year left in office now. GTA 5
is already 2 years old man.. fucking hell.
Those days as a kid in that ALB Metro house, with the two fireplaces, the large den; the
cozy old-school feel.. It's not even close to recent anymore. All this time I've spent as a
shut-in / NEET / outcast.. I remember a time before social media and smartphones. Chad
and Chloe weren't entirely fucking brainless zombies addicted to their screens. They're
still normies though, so they're still absolute scum of the earth who deserve nothing but
a few stabs into their jugular vein. What I'm trying to show you is, the world's a different
place than it was when I was growing up. We're seeing Global warming finally having
some serious effects. We got the USA at the quality of a 3rd world country now, with a
middle class minority, severe poverty, accelerating crime and corruption and the greatest
security state in the world's history on the horizon. Just for typing in these buzzwords,
I'm now on a couple more watchlists, and nobody is going to be reading this shit anyways
except you NSA ass clowns.
Here's something to rustle your jimmies. If I was to reenact the shit I've been doing in
GTA 4, in the real world, I'd probably have a 7-fuckin' star wanted level. I've been going
around driving over thousands of NPCs in central park over and over for shits and giggles,
acting out an ""anders"" dozens of times, beating the shit out of random fuckers and other
shenanigans.
Not much else I feel I should type out anyways. It's already TL;DR but perhaps one of the

you enjoy this entry you crazy ass motherfuckers."

0,"It's been around two months since my last entry. As usual, time is fucking flying, societal
deterioration accelerating, and the collective IQ of the american collective declining.
I will not give exact details, but a mindfuck IRL happened. I quickly JIDF'd a lot of my
troll dust, and have been going incognito a lot more.
My childhood game was briefly revived for a little bit again; I brought in my longtime
friends to play it again, and some kids from the newer version of it checked on the
original. In total, probably 10 people went through my server. I directed a few projects;
recreations of Venice, a Medieval-oriented map, an underwater city (not worked on), along
with other projects. This was a game that was pretty much abandoned (Besides a small
group of people) since 2008, revived with some activity after nearly a decade of rot. I feel
blessed to have experienced some fresh memories of the game.
I'm considering maybe making a blog about the game but I know for a fact nobody would
visit it. Hell, I know for the most part I'm talking to myself on this ""blog"" here, but oh
well.
I'm not trying to talk to myself; I'm trying to document my experiences, and to give some
words of wisdom to you.
I've been neglecting some of my most important work, so I need to knock some sense in
myself. I've done plenty of internet archiving for now, and I've cleaned up one of my more
favourite sites, even if some of the mods and admins on it are autistic cunts. But, nowhere
online is safe from these kinds of people.
It is nearly summer 2016. Time flies fast..
I wont say too much about my personal life as I have plenty of enemies, especially
nowadays.
Filthy degenerates."
0,"It's been about a month since the last entry, save 3 days. I'm currently cooking up some
dinner while I type this but noone gives a damn. A lot has happened in this month, so
far...
One of my good friends, whom I've barely known for less than a year, yet has risen to
be one of my bros, challenged me to a debate. He is of a religion I won't specify (it's not
islam, dont worry) but was challenging my lack of faith in any paranormal / spiritual shit.
So he told me to do a mental ritual. I did, and I asked for what I want (Success with my
endeavors, and meeting girls). I had a 10/10 luck streak that lasted a week. In that time...
5 of the ladies I knew, sent me nudes (each one of them) and got comfortable sexting with
me.
One young woman I know IRL, will be visiting me after this semester's out, and will be
making my life the best it's been since 2008.
I became an admin of a very notable site.
After thinking about a specific reservation and the tragedy that befell them (early in may,
a similar tragedy effected the rez Im from), I found some random Native American dude
on omegle. I went on there to troll but instead had a good conversation with this dude.
He talked to me about how 6 of his friends chose to end it. He is from the poorest rez in
america yet made it to college. Kudos to him.
I talked to a very famous dude (hint: 2011, retaliation against some faggy little bully) for
40 minutes. I went on to skype some chick but she went to bed; instead, the famous dude
was on for once. He allowed people to add him on skype, so I did; I thought it was an
impostor but it was actually him. I brought up the dude I met yesterday, and the famous
dude told me how he talked 13 people out of becoming an hero. Good job man.
I made one of the girls I know into a sort of girlfriend, the first time I had one since 2009.
The luck wore out after a week but I still pray to the specific 'subjects' that I did when I
did the meditation-focus experiment. 666"

0,"[Several separate comments on the topic of school shootings:]
School shooters do it cus they cant get laid
Columbine opened the floodgates / pandora's box. The amount of infamy (on par with
9/11) they got inspired literally thousands of alienated youth into mass violence.
Most school shooters, and a big chunk of mass shooters, cite them as direct inspiration.
violence is the answer if it's self defense
being a retard and murdering everything isn't
most school shooters never kill the people who actually bullied them. Look at Columbine
where they spared the one guy who directly fucked them over. Then 99% of the victims
were high-IQ nerdy types in the library
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push shove, mush; fuck Bush!
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just—
SUICIDE PILLS
MASS MURDER PILLS
they did it for the lulz
Protip to all you totalitarian morons.
The vast majority (like 86%) of school shooters were bullied, often to an extreme.
Bullying, isolation, alienation = lower life span and a fucked up mentality
Relatively lax gun laws won't automatically result in massive homicide rates, but it
definitely helps more nutjobs get armed. However, look how the gun-free-countries
often fare in homicide rates compared to somewhere like Germany, Norway, Finland or
Switzerland, where guns are relatively common and purchaseable. It's the people, not the
laws, people.
Most of school is a fucking nightmare equivalent to prison if you're even an iota unique
or individualistic. This creates a false mentality of what the world is (the real world is still
shit but nothing compared to school) which causes the already mentally fragile bullied
outcasts to become even more alienated and unstable.
Mass shooters / school shooters are given (or at one point, were, before it became an
every-3-second occurance) massive amounts of fame, fangirls, news coverage, etc-
attention they were usually neglected IRL- or rather, the attention they receive is often
negative in nature.
So what would a tl;dr sensible method of reducing the amount of school shootings be? I
got a solution and nobody's gun rights or freedom of expression has to be fucking taken
away by you leftist twats or right wing religious nutjobs.
1. Actually do something about bullying. We don't have to turn our schools into
1984-esque nanny/prison states even more than they already are. Teachers should just
punish bullying for fucking once instead of doing literally nothing to prevent or punish it.
Not that hard, morons. Usually the teachers went out of their way to cover up and protect
the bullies when I was in school, often punishing the victims and treating them as they
were the cause; gaslighting. Course I grew up in a redneck shithole small town that was
stuck in the 50~80s, a stereotypical 80s movie high school.
2. Stop making mass murderers into fucking celebrities. Ghost / blacklist their names.
3. Reform and expand mental healthcare and coverage for as many people as possible.
Bring back institutionalization and effective treatment programs for the societal ills to
keep them from hurting themselves or others, and to help them become productive
societal units.
4. Be excellent to each other.
Not that hard, most people are just pinheads.
However, it is in human nature to persecute the different sheep of the tribe, either into
becoming great leaders or into suicide or violence.
It's in human nature to glorify violence and mass killers.
Humanity is just as primitive, chaotic and violent as the universe's creation. We'll always
be a bunch of crazy ass chimps goin all out.
bullied kid + gun access + media giviing mass shooters fame / fangirls = 3.5% chance of
being a school shooter
address bullying
keep guns away from your troubled kid
stop making murderers into heroes / antihereos / stop rewarding violence and stupidity"

0,"Most of the ""leaders"" of the alt right are directly connected to jews in some way.
Richard Spencer posed with jews and attended some synagogues or other congregations
of the jews before and is likely a CIA plant as previously suggested here.
Alex Jones (who is barely alt-right but the ZOG media will claim he is) legit admits to
being a juden:
Milo is of course jewish.
Andrew Anglin of the Daily Stormer contracted someone (who's cool as fuck) of the
jewish ethnicity to help significantly with building elements of his website, which is most
likely an unwitting infiltrated fbi honeypot by now like Stormfront is.
David Duke seems cool but I wouldn't be surprised if even he is kosher.
The alt-light is equivalent to reddit fags compared to dedicated 8ch pol posters, but is
still superior to neocons and most conservatives. The real alt-right meme is just a rehash
of the concept of Anonymous. Autists trying to claim they own that movement are the
reason why it's probably going to come crashing down in a few years; think Op-Chanology
2.0. The Alt-right is way better than (((neocon))) boomer fucks or neoliberal twats though.
A significant fuel source for infighting within the alt-right (as seen especially on
Daily Stormer and /pol/) is on the issue of women. I'd say on average 15~35% of the
communities to be white knights who put pussy on a pedestal. However, one of the major
ideas kicking off on DS is the idea of White Sharia; of severely oppressing thots and
restricting women's rights. This caused a clear divide in the community with the WKs
having to bow to the will of the majority and the thots in the audience making assclowns
of themselves before getting sent to the kitchen. Most alt-right communities, although
mostly similar, seem to hate other communities guts. /pol/ will talk shit about Daily
Stormer, which will talk shit about Stormfront, etc in a continuing cycle.
Feds usually try to trick aggressive twats into agreeing to acts or conspiracy of violence,
but I think all those clowns should do is to further fuel that divide to fuck the movement
up, something most alt-righters are doing to a small extent already. Regarding the issues
of the migrant crisis, kikery, feminazism, etc, the Alt-Right will definitely survive for
at least half a decade. It's not guaranteed to be the 4th Reich as of now, until another
civil war or civilizational collapse occurs. Granted that trolls boosted Trump into office,
anything is definitely possible."

indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as
long as the principles of public hygiene permit. As soon as they have been untied, the next
